# Salt Map

[Live Site](http://revenantal.com/salt)

Salt map is just a quick little project I made based on the video game [SALT](https://www.saltthegame.com/).

The map data is supplied by WillamSea via [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/salt/mods/7/?tab=files).
<br>The images are supplied by [Kenney's free assets](https://kenney.nl/assets/map-pack).

Feel free to fork and improve upon the general idea!
